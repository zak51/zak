// <-> By default, the engine calculates the time between frames before it processes the client tick. This can lead to a situation where 
// the player's position is from a delayed point in time, even though their inputs are more up-to-date. This command moves the function 
// responsible for sleeping after the tick processing. This means that the sleep will be shorter because the tick processing will be 
// included in the time delta, resulting in increased responsiveness of the game and a reduced amount of world stuttering.

// <i> Works in conjunction with 'r_low_latency' enabled (NVIDIA Low Latency).
// <!> Should benefit from a frame per second limitation (capped 'fps_max').
